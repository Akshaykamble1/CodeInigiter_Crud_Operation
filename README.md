# CodeInigiter_Crud_Operation
in CodeIgniter, CRUD operations are implemented by combining the functionality provided by controllers, models, and views. Controllers handle user requests, models interact with the database to perform CRUD operations, and views are responsible for presenting data to users and capturing user input.
